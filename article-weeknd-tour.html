            <p>On Monday morning, the international pop star The Weeknd canceled his whole world tour after a secret test concert went badly in a private place in Los Angeles studio, leaving his team "unable to guarantee safe sound levels" for the following shows.</p>
            
            <p>According to sources inside the company, the singer was working on a new audio technology capable of creating "floating 3D melodies" around the audience. Several engineers claimed that they have experienced sudden failures in their equipment, where one of them described it as "a sonic wave that made the walls vibrate like liquid." In a leaked statement, The Weeknd's manager said that the artist does not want to put fans in danger and is thinking about releasing the song only online. The fans reacted online immediately, with some praising his caution and others accusing the team of concealing deeper problems: "This technology can't be ready. They know something went very wrong," one social media user said.</p>
            
            <p>The Weeknd is known for his futuristic stage shows, often featuring holographic performances. Before the tour, he said that his new shows would "change how people feel music." His last album, which broke global streaming records, and the tour were supposed to be the largest in his career. Industry analysts say it might set back the next musical era, but The Weeknd assures his followers he will "return stronger with safer, smarter sound."</p>
